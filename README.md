Healthcare Data Cleaning Case Study

Overview 

Welcome to my healthcare data cleaning case study! This project is a deep dive into the steps I took to clean and prepare a dataset of 55,500 healthcare records. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience where I tackled common data issues to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis.

Objectives 

In this case study, I aimed to:

•	Remove Duplicates: I identified and removed duplicate entries to make sure every record was unique.

•	Impute Missing Data: I filled in missing 'Discharge Date' values with the most frequent date, ensuring that the dataset remained complete.

•	Standardize Text Formatting: I standardized text entries across various columns to make the data easier to analyze and interpret.
•	Correct Outliers: I corrected negative billing amounts, which were likely data entry errors, to reflect accurate financial information.

•	Validate Date Sequences: I made sure that all discharge dates followed the corresponding admission dates, maintaining logical consistency in the dataset.

Project Structure 

Here’s how I’ve organized the project:

•	data/: Contains the original and cleaned datasets. You can compare the before and after to see the impact of the cleaning process.
•	scripts/: This folder holds the Excel formulas and any scripts I used to clean the data. If you're interested in the technical details, this is the place to look.
•	documentation/: Here, you’ll find the full case study, where I walk you through my thought process, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

How to Explore the Project

•	Take a Look at the Data: Start by exploring the data folder to see both the raw and cleaned datasets. It’s a great way to see the transformation that took place.

•	Check Out the Scripts: If you’re curious about the nitty-gritty details, head over to the scripts folder where I’ve included the formulas and scripts that made this cleaning possible.
•	Read the Case Study: The documentation folder contains the complete case study. It’s a detailed account of the entire process, from identifying issues to implementing solutions.

A Personal Note 

Working on this project was an incredible learning experience. It reinforced the importance of data cleaning in ensuring accurate and reliable analysis, especially in something as critical as healthcare data. I’m excited to share this work and hope it provides insight into the meticulous process of turning raw data into a valuable asset.
