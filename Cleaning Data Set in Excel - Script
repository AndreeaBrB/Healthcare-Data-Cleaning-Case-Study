**Data Cleaning Process: Healthcare Dataset**

**Objective:**
To clean and prepare a healthcare dataset containing patient information, billing details, and dates for accurate and reliable analysis.


**Step 1: Remove Duplicates**

**Action:**
- Removed duplicate records to ensure that each entry in the dataset is unique.

**Process:**
1. Selected the entire dataset by clicking and dragging across the data range.
2. Navigated to the `Data` tab in the Excel ribbon.
3. Clicked on `Remove Duplicates`.
4. Selected all relevant columns to check for duplicates.
5. Clicked `OK` to remove duplicates, resulting in a dataset with only unique records.

**Outcome:**
- Duplicates were successfully removed, ensuring that each patient record is represented only once in the dataset.


**Step 2: Handle Missing Data**

**Action:**
- Identified and addressed missing data to ensure completeness of the dataset.

**Process:**
1. Applied Conditional Formatting to highlight blank cells:
   - Selected the data range and navigated to `Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule`.
   - Choose `Format only cells that contain` and select `Blanks`.
   - Applied a fill colour to highlight missing data.
2. For numerical columns, filled missing values using the column average:
   - Used the formula `=AVERAGE(A2:A100)` to calculate the average, replacing the range with the appropriate column.
   - Filled missing data with this average value.
3. For text columns, fill missing values with "N/A" or a similar placeholder.

**Outcome:**
- Missing data was filled appropriately, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.


**Step 3: Standardize Text Formatting**

**Action:**
- Standardized text formatting to ensure consistency across the dataset.

**Process:**
1. Created a new column next to each text column requiring standardization.
2. Used the `PROPER` function to capitalize the first letter of each word:
   - Entered the formula `=PROPER(A2)` in the first cell of the new column, replacing `A2` with the appropriate cell reference.
   - Dragged the formula down the entire column to apply it to all rows.
3. Copied the results and used `Paste Special > Values` to replace the original column with the standardized text.
4. Deleted the temporary column used for the formula.

**Outcome:**
- Text fields were standardized, ensuring uniformity in names, medical conditions, and other categorical data.

**Step 4: Correct Data Types**

**Action:**
- Ensured that all columns were formatted with the correct data types for accurate calculations.

**Process:**
1. Selected columns containing dates, numbers, and text.
2. Right-clicked on the selected columns and choose `Format Cells`.
3. Applied the appropriate formats:
   - **Dates:** Formatted as `Date`.
   - **Numbers:** Formatted as `Number` or `Currency`.
   - **Text:** Formatted as `Text`.
4. Reviewed each column to ensure the format was applied correctly.

**Outcome:**
- Data types were correctly assigned, ensuring that all columns were properly formatted for analysis.


**Step 5: Correct or Remove Outliers**

**Action:**
- Identified and corrected or removed outliers that could distort analysis results.

**Process:**
1. Sorted the 'Billing Amount' column from largest to smallest to identify outliers.
2. Applied Conditional Formatting to highlight values above or below certain thresholds:
   - Selected the 'Billing Amount' column.
   - Applied `Highlight Cells Rules > Greater Than` and set a threshold value.
   - Choose a fill colour to highlight outliers.
3. Investigated highlighted values to determine if they were data entry errors or legitimate outliers.
4. Corrected data entry errors and removed irrelevant outliers from the analysis.

**Outcome:**
- Outliers were managed appropriately, ensuring that the data reflects realistic billing scenarios.


**Step 6: Remove Unwanted Characters**

**Action:**
- Removed unwanted characters (e.g., commas) from text fields to improve data consistency.

**Process:**
1. Selected the column containing unwanted characters.
2. Opened the Find and Replace dialog box by pressing `Command + F` (Mac).
3. In the `Replace` tab, entered the unwanted character (`,`) in the "Find what" field.
4. Left the "Replace with" field blank.
5. Clicked `Replace All` to remove all instances of the unwanted character.

**Outcome:**
- Unwanted characters were successfully removed, ensuring clean and consistent text data.


**Step 7: Validate Relationships Between Data**

**Action:**
- Ensured logical consistency between related data points, such as 'Admission Date' and 'Discharge Date'.

**Process:**
1. Created a new column named "Date Check" to validate the relationship between 'Admission Date' and 'Discharge Date'.
2. Entered the following formula in the new column:
   ```excel
   =IF(C2 > B2, "Valid", "Invalid")
   ```
   - This formula checks if the 'Discharge Date' (C2) is after the 'Admission Date' (B2).
3. Dragged the formula down the column to apply it to all rows.
4. Reviewed the "Date Check" column to identify any "Invalid" entries.
5. Investigated and corrected any rows where the discharge date occurred before the admission date.

**Outcome:**
- Logical consistency between dates was verified, and any inconsistencies were corrected.



**Step 8: Final Data Review**

**Action:**
- Conducted a final review to ensure the dataset is fully cleaned and ready for analysis.

**Process:**
1. Reviewed all columns for completeness and consistency.
2. Applied filters and sorting to double-check for any remaining errors or inconsistencies.
3. Saved the cleaned dataset as a new file to preserve the original data.

**Outcome:**
- The dataset was successfully cleaned, ensuring that it is accurate, consistent, and ready for in-depth analysis.
